[2025-03-24],[07:00 PM PDT] â€“ Milestone 1: Develop a Git Auto Commit Extension for VS Code

a. Executive Summary

    We are initiating Milestone 1, which focuses on developing a VS Code extension to automate Git commits on file save. The first steps involve setting up the VS Code extension project, creating the necessary files, and prompting the user to create a PROGRESS.log file to track progress. No results are available yet as this is the starting point.

b. Progress Log

[Initially empty, to be updated after replying to the first user feedback]

c. Current Issue/s

    Setting up the VS Code extension project structure in TypeScript/Node.js.
    Prompting the user to create the PROGRESS.log file for tracking progress.
    Implementing the initial extension logic to detect file saves and trigger Git commits.

d. Next Steps or Fix/es

    Create a new VS Code extension project using the Yeoman generator.
    et up the basic extension structure and configure it to detect file saves.
    Prompt the user to create the PROGRESS.log file in the project directory.
    Begin implementing the Git auto-commit functionality.
