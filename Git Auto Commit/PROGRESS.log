Milestone 1: Develop a Git Auto Commit Extension for VS Code

[2025-03-24 07:00 PM PDT] Initialized the ADP Git Auto Commit extension project in ADP/Milestone 1.
[2025-03-24 11:30 PM NZDT] User initialized a Git repository at the DLI Systems ADP level, installed Yeoman and VS Code Extension Generator, generated the adp-git-auto-commit extension project in DLI Systems ADP/Git Auto Commit/adp-git-auto-commit, and created the PROGRESS.log file in DLI Systems ADP/Git Auto Commit.
Monday, 25 March 2025 at 12:00 AM NZDT – User updated the file structure by removing CHANGELOG.md and README.md from adp-git-auto-commit, added PROMPT_ENVIRO.md and MILESTONE.md, updated .gitignore, and attempted to install simple-git (with an error due to an incorrect path). The user also updated src/extension.ts to detect file saves and attempted to test in EDH, but EDH failed to load.
Monday, 25-Mar-2025 at 01:00 AM NZDT – User installed simple-git successfully, reinstalled dependencies, ran npx tsc with no errors, updated package.json, installed the amodio.tsl-problem-matcher extension, and updated src/extension.ts with Git commit logic. Encountered a TypeScript error in extension.ts and persistent issues with EDH not loading.
Monday, 25-Mar-2025 at 02:00 AM NZDT – User updated package.json, ran npx tsc on extension.ts, but encountered a TypeScript error regarding the catch clause variable type. Confirmed launch.json has the watch task. EDH loading issue persists. Next steps include fixing the TypeScript error and continuing to debug EDH.
Tuesday, 26-Mar-2025 at 12:00 AM NZDT – User fixed the TypeScript error in extension.ts, ran npm run watch, confirmed the dist folder contains extension.js, and successfully launched EDH. Output panel logs show the extension host starting with some warnings about resource-scoped configurations. Next steps include testing the Git commit functionality and addressing the warnings.
Tuesday, 26-Mar-2025 at 12:00 AM NZDT – Reverted to previous feedback state as user has not yet provided feedback on requested actions. Awaiting user feedback on testing the Git commit functionality and updating extension.ts for meaningful commit messages.
Tuesday, 26-Mar-2025 at 11:00 PM NZDT – User tested the Git commit functionality in EDH by creating and saving test.txt. No notifications were shown, and the "ADP Git Auto Commit" channel was not available in the Output panel. Git history shows a commit for test.txt, but it’s attributed to "[CDAI]". A Debug Console error was observed regarding a duplicate controller ID from the Extension Test Runner.
Tuesday, 26-Mar-2025 at 11:30 PM NZDT – User updated package.json and extension.ts, disabled the Extension Test Runner, and retested the Git commit functionality in EDH. No notifications were shown, the "ADP Git Auto Commit" channel is missing, and the Output panel shows GitLens errors and extension host termination. A Git message indicates uncommitted changes in the workspace.
Wednesday, 27-Mar-2025 at 12:00 AM NZDT – User committed uncommitted changes, opened the workspace file, disabled GitLens, and retested the Git commit functionality in EDH. No notifications or "ADP Git Auto Commit" channel were observed, and the Output panel shows extension host termination issues. A nested Git repository (kevinheard) was identified. Next steps include removing the nested repository and retesting.
Wednesday, 27-Mar-2025 at 12:30 AM NZDT – User removed the nested Git repository, updated package.json and extension.ts, and reviewed the file structure in the Git Auto Commit folder. The extension still isn’t activating. Next steps include debugging the activation issue and retesting the Git commit functionality.
Wednesday, 27-Mar-2025 at 01:00 AM NZDT – User checked the Extension Host logs in EDH, which show no activity from the adp-git-auto-commit extension. GitLens errors persist despite being disabled. The user added the adp-git-auto-commit workspace to the extension folder, which is incorrect. Next steps include correcting the workspace setup, running EDH with minimal extensions, and retesting the extension activation.
Wednesday, 27-Mar-2025 at 01:30 AM NZDT – User opened the Git Auto Commit.code-workspace file, disabled non-essential extensions, and launched EDH. The Extension Host logs show the adp-git-auto-commit extension activating, but a "No workspace folder found" notification appeared. The user incorrectly added the adp-git-auto-commit folder to the workspace again. Next steps include fixing the workspace configuration and retesting the extension activation.
Wednesday, 27-Mar-2025 at 02:00 AM NZDT – User updated the Git Auto Commit.code-workspace file, opened the workspace, and confirmed the setup is correct. The user launched EDH with minimal extensions, but the Hello World command failed with a "command not found" error. The Extension Host logs show the adp-git-auto-commit extension activating, and the Output panel shows the extension’s logs, but the workspace root issue persists.
Wednesday, 27-Mar-2025 at 02:30 AM NZDT – User updated package.json and extension.ts, reopened the Git Auto Commit.code-workspace file, and launched EDH. The Extension Host logs show the adp-git-auto-commit extension activating, but the Hello World command failed with a "command not found" error. The Output panel shows the extension’s logs, but the workspace root detection issue persists.
Wednesday, 27-Mar-2025 at 03:00 AM NZDT – User updated launch.json, reopened the Git Auto Commit.code-workspace file, and launched EDH. The Extension Host logs show the adp-git-auto-commit extension activating, but the Hello World command failed with a "command not found" error, and the ADP Git Auto Commit channel is not available. The extension detected a file save event but failed to auto-commit due to a .gitignore issue. The workspace root detection issue persists.
Wednesday, 27-Mar-2025 at 03:30 AM NZDT – User updated extension.ts, but encountered a TypeScript error related to the git.add method’s argument type. The error indicates a mismatch between the expected callback type and the provided arguments.
Wednesday, 27-Mar-2025 at 04:00 AM NZDT – User updated extension.ts with no errors, updated the .gitignore file to allow committing .vscode files, and retested the Hello World command in EDH. The command failed with a "command not found" error, and the ADP Git Auto Commit channel is not available in the Output panel. The workspace root detection issue persists.
