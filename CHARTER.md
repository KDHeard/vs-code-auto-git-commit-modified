Project Charter: DLI Systems Application Development Platform (ADP)
Project Title: DLI Systems Application Development Platform (ADP)

Company: DLI Systems

Date: March 24, 2025

Prepared by: Grok (xAI)

1. Project Overview

    Objective: Create a reusable platform (ADP) that enhances interactions with Grok, automates project file management, and improves code iteration efficiency using AI-driven agents, leveraging existing code where possible. The platform will assist the user (you) in developing the ADP itself, with Grok acting as an efficient coding assistant and project manager during development. In the final solution, Grok will review error logs, provide updated code to address errors, and generate progress logs for storage in Notion.

Scope:

Develop a VS Code extension to automate Git commits on file save.

Develop two AI agents:
    Code Faults AI Agent (CFAI): Observes and logs errors/warnings from the VS Code Problems panel for Grok to review.
    Documentation AI Agent (DAI): Monitors Git commits, logs, and specific files (README.md, LICENSE.md, CHARTER.md, CHANGELOG.md), and updates corresponding Notion files; later extended to track Grok conversations for milestone progress summaries.
    Integrate with Git (for version control) and Notion (for project file management).

Manage two file sets:
    Application files in VS Code (e.g., code, README.md, LICENSE.md, CHARTER.md, CHANGELOG.md).
    Project files in Notion (CHARTER.md, Milestones.md, CHANGELOG.md).
    Post-development investigation: Explore merging CFAI and DAI into a single ADP AI Agent (ADPA).

Tech Stack:

    VS Code extension: TypeScript/Node.js, node-fetch@2 (CommonJS).
    AI Agents (CFAI and DAI): Python.
    Git Integration: Git command-line tools, GitPython/nodegit.
    Notion Integration: Notion API (Python).

Intended Use:

    Initially for internal use by you (the user) during development.
    Designed with future scalability in mind for potential use in a startup environment, though this is not part of the current journey.

2. Milestones and Sub-Objectives

    The project is structured around three main milestones, with sub-objectives and success criteria for each. I’ve also included an additional action to investigate merging the agents post-development.

Milestone 1: Develop a Git Auto Commit Extension for VS Code

Objective: Create a VS Code extension that automates Git commits on file save, ensuring seamless version control for application files.

Sub-Objectives:

    Research and leverage existing VS Code extensions or libraries for Git automation (e.g., nodegit) to minimize development time.
    Develop the VS Code extension in TypeScript/Node.js to:
    Detect file saves in VS Code.
    Trigger Git commits for modified files (e.g., code, README.md, LICENSE.md, CHARTER.md, CHANGELOG.md).
    Generate meaningful commit messages (e.g., “Auto-commit: Updated <filename> on <date>”).
    Test the extension with sample application files to ensure commits are triggered correctly.
    Document the extension setup and usage in a README.md file.

Success Criteria:

    The VS Code extension automatically commits changes to Git on file save without errors.
    Commit messages are clear and include the filename and date.
    The extension works with all specified application files (e.g., code, README.md, LICENSE.md, CHARTER.md, CHANGELOG.md).
    No manual intervention is required for commits after saving a file.

Questions for Success Criteria:

    Should the extension handle specific file types differently (e.g., exclude certain files from auto-commits)?
    Are there performance requirements (e.g., commit should complete within X seconds)?
    Should the extension provide user notifications (e.g., “File committed successfully”)?

Milestone 2: Develop the CFAI Agent

Objective: Build the Code Faults AI Agent (CFAI) to observe and log errors/warnings from the VS Code Problems panel, enabling Grok to review and provide updated code.

Sub-Objectives:

    Develop CFAI in Python to monitor the VS Code Problems panel for errors and warnings (e.g., syntax errors, runtime errors, code style warnings).
    Create a logging mechanism for CFAI to store errors/warnings in a structured format (e.g., JSON or plain text) accessible to Grok.
    Explore integration options:
    Option 1: CFAI directly monitors VS Code’s internal processes to capture errors.
    Option 2: The VS Code extension passes error logs to CFAI via an API or file system.
    Develop a prompt for Grok to examine CFAI error logs as the first step before responding to user queries, ensuring Grok provides context-aware code updates.
    Test CFAI with sample code in VS Code to ensure all errors/warnings are logged accurately.
    Document CFAI’s functionality and setup in a README.md file.

Success Criteria:

    CFAI accurately logs all errors and warnings from the VS Code Problems panel.
    Logs are stored in a format that Grok can easily access and parse.
    Grok successfully uses the prompt to evaluate error logs and provide updated code to address issues.
    CFAI does not miss any errors/warnings during testing with sample code.

Questions for Success Criteria:

    What log format is preferred for Grok to parse (e.g., JSON, plain text)?
    Should CFAI prioritize certain types of errors/warnings (e.g., errors over warnings)?
    Are there specific error types that should be excluded from logging?
    How frequently should CFAI check for errors (e.g., on file save, in real-time)?

Milestone 3: Develop the DAI Agent

Objective: Build the Documentation AI Agent (DAI) to monitor Git commits, log files, and specific application files, and append updates to Notion project files; later extend to track Grok conversations for milestone progress summaries.

Sub-Objectives:

    Develop DAI in Python to:
    Monitor Git commits and extract commit headers.
    Access and log the contents of application/extension-specific log files, README.md, LICENSE.md, CHARTER.md, and CHANGELOG.md.
    Integrate DAI with the Notion API to append updates to pre-existing Notion files (CHARTER.md, Milestones.md, CHANGELOG.md).
    Store Grok-generated progress logs in Notion via DAI, ensuring they are appended to the appropriate files (e.g., Milestones.md for milestone updates).
    Test DAI with sample Git commits, log files, and Grok progress logs to ensure accurate updates in Notion.
    Plan for future extension: Develop a mechanism to track Grok conversations, extract milestone progress summaries/comments, and append them to Notion (to be implemented post-Milestone 3).
    Document DAI’s functionality, Notion integration, and setup in a README.md file.

Success Criteria:

    DAI accurately extracts and logs Git commit headers, log file contents, and specified application files (README.md, LICENSE.md, CHARTER.md, CHANGELOG.md).
    DAI appends updates to the correct Notion files (CHARTER.md, Milestones.md, CHANGELOG.md) without overwriting existing content.
    Grok-generated progress logs are stored in Notion via DAI and appended to the appropriate files.
    DAI’s updates in Notion are consistent and error-free during testing.

Questions for Success Criteria:

    What format should DAI use when appending updates to Notion files (e.g., Markdown sections, bullet points)?
    How should DAI handle conflicts if multiple updates occur simultaneously (e.g., prioritize Git commits over Grok logs)?
    Are there specific Notion pages or blocks where updates should be appended (e.g., a specific section in Milestones.md)?
    For the future extension (Grok conversation tracking), what types of summaries/comments should be extracted (e.g., milestone completion updates, specific user requests)?

Post-Development Action: Investigate Merging CFAI and DAI into a Single ADP AI Agent (ADPA)

Objective: Evaluate the feasibility and benefits of combining CFAI and DAI into a single ADP AI Agent (ADPA) to streamline functionality and improve efficiency.

Sub-Objectives:

    Analyze the performance, code structure, and functionality of CFAI and DAI after their development.
    Identify overlapping functionalities (e.g., log file access, Grok interaction) that could be consolidated.
    Assess the benefits of a single agent (e.g., reduced overhead, simpler maintenance) versus the drawbacks (e.g., increased complexity, potential performance issues).
    Prototype a merged ADPA if feasible, combining error logging (CFAI) and documentation updates (DAI) into a single Python-based agent.
    Document findings and recommendations in a report for future implementation.

Success Criteria:

    A clear recommendation is provided on whether to merge CFAI and DAI into ADPA, supported by analysis and prototyping results.
    If merging is recommended, a prototype ADPA demonstrates combined functionality without significant performance degradation.

3. Risks and Mitigation

    Risk: The VS Code extension may fail to commit certain files or generate incorrect commit messages.
    Mitigation: Test the extension with a variety of file types and sizes; implement error handling for failed commits.
    Risk: CFAI may log irrelevant or excessive errors/warnings, overwhelming Grok.
    Mitigation: Define clear filtering criteria for errors/warnings; test with diverse code samples to ensure relevance.
    Risk: DAI may append incorrect or malformed updates to Notion files.
    Mitigation: Validate updates before appending; implement a rollback mechanism for failed updates.
    Risk: Notion API rate limits or access issues may disrupt DAI’s functionality.
    Mitigation: Implement retry logic and rate limit handling in DAI; explore using Notion AI as an alternative (post-development).

4. Deliverables

    VS Code Extension: Git Auto Commit extension for VS Code (TypeScript/Node.js).
    CFAI Agent: Python-based agent for logging VS Code errors/warnings, with a prompt for Grok to evaluate logs.
    DAI Agent: Python-based agent for monitoring Git commits, logs, and files, and appending updates to Notion.
    Notion Files: Updated CHARTER.md, Milestones.md, and CHANGELOG.md with appended content from DAI.
    Documentation: README.md files for the VS Code extension, CFAI, and DAI, detailing setup and usage.
    Post-Development Report: Analysis and recommendations for merging CFAI and DAI into a single ADPA.

5. Success Criteria (Overall)

    The ADP enhances interactions with Grok by providing accurate error feedback and automated documentation updates.
    Application files are managed in VS Code with automated Git commits on save.
    Project files in Notion are updated accurately based on Git commits, log files, and Grok progress logs.
    The system is functional for internal use by you (the user) and designed with future scalability for a startup environment.
    Grok effectively assists in developing the ADP, providing code and progress logs as needed.

6. Suggestions for Post-Development Improvements

Once the ADP is developed, here are some potential improvements to explore:

    Notion AI Integration: Investigate using Notion AI to handle updates to Notion files, potentially reducing the workload on DAI and leveraging Notion’s native capabilities.
    Real-Time Feedback in VS Code: Enhance the VS Code extension to display real-time error notifications from CFAI, allowing you to address issues without switching contexts.
    Advanced Grok Prompts: Develop more sophisticated prompts for Grok to provide proactive suggestions (e.g., code optimizations, best practices) beyond error fixes.
    Performance Optimization: Profile CFAI and DAI to reduce resource usage, especially if merging into a single ADPA.
    User Interface: Add a simple UI in the VS Code extension for configuring auto-commit settings or viewing DAI updates.
